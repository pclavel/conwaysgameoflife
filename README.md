***Conway's Game of Life***

**Definition**

You are encouraged to solve this task according to the task description, using any language you may know.
The Game of Life is a   cellular automaton   devised by the British mathematician   John Horton Conway   in 1970.   It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton.

Conway's game of life is described here: A cell C is represented by 
* a 1   when cellStatus
* or 0 when dead

in an m-by-m (or mÃ—m) square array of cells.

We calculate N - the sum of live cells in C's eight-location neighbourhood,  then cell C is cellStatus or dead in the next generation based on the following table:

*   C   N                 new C
*   1   0,1             ->  0  # Lonely
*   1   4,5,6,7,8       ->  0  # Overcrowded
*   1   2,3             ->  1  # Lives
*   0   3               ->  1  # It takes three to give birth!
*   0   0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8 ->  0  # Barren

Assume cells beyond the boundary are always dead.

The "game" is actually a zero-player game, meaning that its evolve is determined by its initial state, needing no input from human players.   One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.


Although you should test your implementation on more complex examples such as the   glider   in a larger universe,   show the action of the blinker   (three adjoining cells in a row all cellStatus),   over three generations, in a 3 by 3 grid.

**To run it**

You can run the main method in Game.kt, which will run and print 10 evolutions for a fixed configuration. You can modify the method to have different start configurations or run more evolutions.

**TODOs**

* In the implementation part, I am missing tests on the Organism class. It triggers an interesting challenge on how to mock the cells in the organism, considering that only the organism has access to them. I don't want to use PowerMockito, so I need to think a little bit on it. Maybe injecting the CellFactory is not a bad idea, as you could have different Cell implementations and play with them.
* Cells could count the cycles they stay alive (age), and emit metrics on dead time. Same for number of times they spawn.
* Random start configuration: imagine a thunder hitting the organism and spawing a random number of cells. Maybe, thunders can happen every so often, killing and spawing cells.
* Cells could have an expected life time...
* This can be the new Clash of Clans!
